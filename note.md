This interface indicates that when you use this component, you should pass an object with two properties:

course: An object of type Course with an additional constraint that its chapters property is an array where each element is of type Chapter with a userProgress property of type UserProgress[] | null.

progressCount: A numeric property of type number.

/_  
interface CourseNavbarProps {
course: Course & {
chapters: (Chapter & {
userProgress: UserProgress[] | null; /_ Array of UserProgress or null for the first chapter \*/,
})[];
};
progressCount: number;
}

In Clerk authentication, the functions
useAuth(), auth(), and currentUser() are commonly
used to handle user authentication and retrieve information about the currently logged-in user. Here's an explanation of each function:

# useAuth(): This function is a hook provided by Clerk that allows you to access the authentication-related functionality within your application. By calling useAuth(), you can access the authentication state and user information, such as the current user's ID, email, and other details. This hook typically returns an object with properties and methods related to authentication.

Example usage:

import { useAuth } from '@clerk/clerk-react';

function MyComponent() {
const { user } = useAuth();

// Access user information
console.log(user.id);
console.log(user.email);

// ... rest of the component
}

# auth(): This function is provided by Clerk and offers a set of methods for authentication-related operations, such as signing in, signing out, and other authentication flows. With auth(), you can perform actions like creating a new user account, logging in, resetting passwords, and more.

Example usage:
import { auth } from '@clerk/clerk-react';

// Sign in example
async function signIn(email, password) {
try {
await auth.signIn(email, password);
console.log('Sign in successful!');
} catch (error) {
console.error('Sign in failed:', error);
}
}

# currentUser(): This function is also provided by Clerk and returns the current user object. The currentUser() function allows you to access information about the currently logged-in user, such as their email, ID, and any custom data associated with their account.

Example usage:

import { currentUser } from '@clerk/clerk-sdk-node';

const user = currentUser();

console.log(user.id);
console.log(user.email);

This is a data model defined using Prisma, a modern database toolkit for TypeScript and Node.js. Let's break down the relationships:

# Course Model:

Course has a one-to-many relationship with Chapter (one course can have multiple chapters).
Course has a one-to-many relationship with Attachment (one course can have multiple attachments).
Course has a many-to-one relationship with Category (many courses can belong to one category).
Course has a one-to-many relationship with Purchase (one course can be purchased by multiple users).

# Category Model:

Category has a one-to-many relationship with Course (one category can have multiple courses).

# Attachment Model:

Attachment has a many-to-one relationship with Course (many attachments can belong to one course).

# Chapter Model:

Chapter has a many-to-one relationship with Course (many chapters can belong to one course).
Chapter has a one-to-one relationship with MuxData (one chapter has one associated MuxData).

# MuxData Model:

MuxData has a one-to-one relationship with Chapter (one MuxData belongs to one chapter).

# UserProgress Model:

UserProgress has a many-to-one relationship with Chapter (many user progresses can be associated with one chapter).
UserProgress has a unique constraint on the combination of userId and chapterId, ensuring a user can mark a chapter as completed only once.

# Purchase Model:

Purchase has a many-to-one relationship with Course (many purchases can be associated with one course).
Purchase has a unique constraint on the combination of userId and courseId, ensuring a user can purchase a course only once.

# StripeCustomer Model:

StripeCustomer represents a separate entity for handling Stripe-related data.
StripeCustomer has a one-to-one relationship with User (one Stripe customer corresponds to one user).
These relationships define how different entities in the system are connected and interact with each other, providing a structured and organized way to handle data in the application.
